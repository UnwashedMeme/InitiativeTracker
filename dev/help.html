<h2 id="extension">Firefox Extension</h2>
There is a firefox extension called "Initiative Tracker Helper".  It allows you
to right click on any page and automatically add it to Initiative Tracker, and
have it parsed.  The extension is available here: 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10968" target="_blank">

<h2 id="cookies">Viewing Pages That Require A Login</h2>
<p>
    Depending on your browser settings you may not be able to view pages in
    Initiative Tracker that require a login (such as the D&D compendium).  
    This is related to a browser security issue called "3rd party cookies".  
    You are required to log on to the secure page (since Initiative Tracker
    just shows pages that you have a valid right to be at) but your browser
    prevents you because its worried about the remote page creating a 3rd party
    coookie.  If you are experiencing this issue, then your browser is configured
    to reject 3rd party cookies.  Which is generally a good thing.  Fortunately
    most browsers have a mechanism to allow 3rd party cookies from specific 
    sites.
</p>
    <img src="help/cookies/Error.jpg"/>
<p>
    The easiest way to get around this issue is to just enable 3rd party cookies.
    However, that is not reccomended, because it would allow data mining 
    advertising companies to potentially track your progress across the web.  
    Instead you should just allow cookies from specific sites you intend to use
    with Initiative Tracker.

<h2 id="DataGone">My Data Is Gone!</h2>
<p>
<em>"I just came back to the site and my data is gone!"</em>
</p>
<p>
On June 29, 2009 the way the application stores data changed slightly.  A small
subset of users will not be able to access their data with the new version.  The
new version <strong>cannot</strong> access your data because of security 
restrictions.  You can however continue to use the old version which 
<strong>can</strong> read your data.  You can find it at:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.initiativetracker.com/recovery">http://www.initiativetracker.com/recovery</a>
</p>
<p>
At some point in the future I plan to implement an utility to import/export 
data, at which point you should be able to export your data from the recovery
page and import it into the main page.

<h2 id="Navigate Away">Pages That Navigate Away From Initiative Tracker</h2>
<p>
<em>"I added a page and now whenever I start InitiativeTracker, once its 
finished loading it switches to that page."</em>
</p>
<p>
This can happen if a page has automatic code to break itself out of other sites 
that contain it.  Sites sometimes do this to prevent other sites from including
their content and passing it off as their own.  If you add such a site, as soon
as Initiative Tracker loads it, it will force your browser to its own site.
</p>
<p>
In the future I would like to detect this behaviour and prevent it somehow, but
in the meantime there is something you can do if this happens to you.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open up the Initative Tracker page and let it take you to the other page.</li>
    <li>Click back</li>
    <li>As soon InitiativeTracker is loaded and you see the loading graphic appear click stop.</li>
    <li>Click the New Combat button or remove the offending combatant.</li>
</ol>
